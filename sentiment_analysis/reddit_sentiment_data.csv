trading options vs stock equity,"hey guys ive been looking through this subreddit and it looks like a lot of you trade call and put options on stocks instead of the actual stock equity itself 

ive read a few books on stock options trading when i considered doing it not considering anymore and it always surprised me why people would do it because it seems way more risky and more importantly much much more difficult in stock options you often have to deal with not just the risk of the stocks price move but also implied volatility time decay and delta and on top of that you risk losing the entire premium paid for the option if the stocks price doesnt go overunder your strike price and these premiums can get very expensive if you lose a couple of bets in a row

obviously theres multiple different ways you could combine these options to lower or amplify your risk but to me that just gives more points of riskfailure of losing your investment if you dont consider and do the proper dd

this is not to say people shouldnt trade options im just not smart enough to trade them profitably but for those of you who do trade options how profitable has it been for you and how much more difficult is it than simply trading stock equity and is the increased difficulty worth it",0,2025-03-19T20:15:47,1,[],https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeynrl/trading_options_vs_stock_equity/,0.0,-0.8509,[],-0.42545
boj keeps interest rates steady warns of trump tariff risks,"

governor ueda warns of heightening global uncertainty

ueda says domestic economy in line with bojs forecasts

wage food price gains may affect underlying inflation

tokyo march 19 reutersreuters
  the bank of japan kept interest rates steady on wednesday and warned of heightening global economic uncertainty suggesting the timing of further rate hikes will depend largely on the fallout from potentially higher us tariffs

but governor kazuo ueda also said rising food costs and strongerthanexpected wage growth could push up underlying inflation highlighting the central banks attention to mounting domestic price pressures

japans wage and price conditions are on track possibly stronger than expected but the uncertain us and global outlook makes it difficult to assess the potential impact on japans economy ueda told a press conference

as such we would like to look at upcoming data in early april to reconsider our forecasts ueda said

he offered few hints on the next ratehike timing but said the boj did not necessarily need to wait until everything is clear on the impact of us tariffs in pulling the trigger

trumps trade war 20 the stocks im watching,"with trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force ive been analyzing what this means for us equities his latest moves25 steel and aluminum tariffs expanded levies on chinese imports and a tariffheavy negotiation strategyecho his first term but with even stronger measures



while 20182020 gave us some clues the market setup in 2025 is different

 higher inflation  rates tariffs add inflationary pressure making the feds job harder

 chinas response will change unlike in 2018 china now dominates ev battery production and controls rare earth supply chainsthis could hurt us tech more than before

 supply chain resilience is mixed companies have talked about reshoring for years but its still expensive and slow

given these factors heres how im positioning

likely winners

1 steel  aluminum nue stld clf  tariffs give them pricing power though cost inflation is a risk

2 defense  cybersecurity lmt pltr crwd  america first likely means higher defense budgets

3 regional banks jpm bac gs  if deregulation follows these should gain

4 domestic infrastructure cat de osk  if tariffs hurt foreign suppliers us construction demand rises



likely losers

1 tech giants aapl nvda qcom intc  heavy china exposure  supply chain and revenue risks

2 consumer goods nke wmt dg  imports get pricier and passing costs to lowerincome customers is tough

3 auto  industrial tsla gm f mmm  higher input costs  china retaliation  pain

4 agri exporters adm tsn bg  if china targets us farm products again these get hit



what im watching

 will china retaliate with rare earth metal export bans impacts tsla nvda qcom

 do inflation expectations rise pushing fed policy hawkish bad for ratesensitive stocks

 does trump backtrack on any tariffs a la 2019

nvidia gm announce deal for ai factories and nextgen vehicles,"general motors and nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its nextgeneration vehicles advanced driverassistance systems and factories

the companies on tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using nvidia compute platforms including omniverse with cosmos for optimizing gms factory planning and robotics

the detroit automaker also said it will use nvidia drive agx for invehicle hardware for future advanced driverassistance systems and incabin enhanced safety driving experiences

gm declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with nvidia the tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business which has notably included substantial work in data centers and gpus

the era of physical ai is here and together with gm were transforming transportation from vehicles to the factories where theyre made jensen huang nvidia founder and ceo said in a release we are thrilled to partner with gm to build ai systems tailored to their vision craft and knowhow

gm has been using nvidia graphics processing units or gpus for training ai models across various areas of its business including simulation and validation the new business expands to invehicle hardware automotive plant design and operations the companies said

the automaker also had been testing nvidias omniverse since at least 2022 some of gms testing was in designing a digital twin or replica of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development it also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in according to a video last year featuring gm for nvidias gtc developer conference in 2023

nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with gm midlast year for omniverse according to an internal company email viewed by cnbc at that time two sources with gm signaled the automaker wasnt sure nvidias software and gpus were worth the high cost compared with other companies

it wasnt immediately clear what sealed the deal for gm but since that time both companies have experienced increased competition from china and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs gms stock is off roughly 8 during in 2025 while nvidia is off about 12 this year

ai not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship gm ceo mary barra said in nvidias release by merging technology with human ingenuity we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond

the companies announced the new initiatives in connection with nvidias gtc ai conference this week in california

nvidia describes omniverse as a platform for developing and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications its essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital or software world to optimize processes using a digital twin of a physical environment such as a gm design facility or plant

users of nvidias omniverse have included bmw amazon robotics and samsung rev lebaredian nvidia vice president of omniverse and simulation technology said during a media briefing a year ago he said the company was licensing omniverse for 4500 per gpu per year

its unclear how many gpus gm will need but given the amount of robotics sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant it would likely be quite a bit

more than 20 other automakers have used nvidias system on a chip hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles including mercedes benz volvo audi volkswagen and byd according to an industry equity research note from jeffries in november 2023

in recent years nvidia has seen soaring demand for its gpus which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to ai inference and training

why tesla deserves a look and probably a buy at these levels,"we know the story elons right leanings are causing his core customers to revolt

this has killed sentiment dropping the stock to uncanny low levels

a few assumptions

1 analysts expect revenue 3 years out are expected to be 200 billion 

2 tesla has had a ps multiple between 6 and 28 historically

i built a matrix pricing tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150180200210225 2510base5125 on that revenue estimate

this yields a market cap of 900 to 2250 or a 3 year return ranging between 747 and 4586 per year they have also had minimal dilution in recent years

i know i know elon is doing irreparable harm to the tesla brand its just like chipotle with ecoli vw cheated on emissions equifax leaking all our data wells fargo opening accounts and so on 

doge is set to terminate in july of 2026 starting the distancing from trump

for better or worse fair or unfair tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting fsd approved thanks to elons position 

overtime i expect tesla will be valued like apple not legacy auto why well for one tesla doesnt have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons apple has lumpy iphone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue tesla at maturity has the same potential lumpy car sales with subscriptions to fsd insurance app store robotaxi repairs and maintenance etc this is the reason i used 610x sales above these are around the multiple apple has been valued at in recent years

additionally the following is true

they sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers

they are one of the few to make evs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto cant compete at

tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and fsd

never mix politics and portfolios

people panic selling during the latest dips,"ive been seeing a lot of posts about people that are invested in index funds in the united states that are talking about how they panic sold or how theyre pulling everything out of their investments and putting it into cash

just wondering how many of you agree that this goes against the philosophy of staying the course and think this is stupid  besides the fact that selling can have a tax implication if youre in a brokerage in my brain this is timing the market

if everybody thinks something is going to happen does that not mean the thing is in someways also priced in   no doubt in my mind that the stupid shit that trump is doing is going to cause more dips and a lot more red days

but people pulling their investments out into cash right now are panic selling in my mind  the only thing that happens when people panic cell is the wealthy buy those stocks at a discount

if i was sitting on individual stocks then yeah id be a lot worried  but im very broadly diversified  i actually threw a chunk in last week and am scruffy buying the dip

the amount of people screaming its different this time and the number of top comments being like glad i sold everything and go out when i did are really shocking i think this is what is talked about when people say the words panic selling  the fact that so many people are saying this in the market is being driven by extreme fear makes me feel like there may be a degree of mass hysteria happening

ram owner wants to bring cheaper pickup back to us,"


stellantis nv thinks theres still demand for an affordable version of its ram 1500 pickup truck in the us market after the strippeddown ram classic ceased production last year chief financial officer doug ostermann said

we need to introduce kind of a lowerend trim of the new pickup to fill that gap ostermann said at a wolfe research conference on tuesday cautioning that it would not come to market immediately

dodge ram is owned by stellantis nv a multinational automotive corporation formed on january 16 2021 following the merger of fiat chrysler automobiles fca and the french psa group peugeot this merger created stellantis which now oversees a vast portfolio of brands including dodge jeep ram fiat and peugeot

in 2024 stellantis faced significant challenges including a sharp decline in us sales leading to a 16 drop despite overall market growth 

this downturn was partly attributed to aggressive costcutting measures under ceo carlos tavares such as reducing popular jeep models which some believed harmed longterm demand these strategies led to internal disagreements culminating in tavaress abrupt resignation in december 2024   

additionally labor tensions escalated when stellantis filed a federal lawsuit against the united auto workers uaw alleging violations of their contract due to strike threats  

in 2025 stellantis unveiled plans to revitalize the dodge brand lineup and detailed a strategy emphasizing increased marketing expenditures competitive incentive programs and the introduction of more affordable vehicle trims",107,2025-03-19T02:02:07,72,"['make a normal sized truck\n\nthe 1500  150 series has doubled in size and reduced in capability\n\nits fkn dumb\n\nthe light trucks are the same size as full ones from 15 years ago', 'we need toyota to bring hilux to us to fuck some shit up', 'absolute shit company', 'they need to bring back the damn dakota and maybe a version of the rampage they have zero ram offerings in the small or mid size pickup arena unless you count the jeep gladiator which is more jeep and less pickup and i say that as a gladiator owner i love it to death but its not appealing to the same audience as the coloradocanyon tacoma ridgeline or frontier', '1015k truck would be great i feel like they mean a 3035k truck', 'they could make a 15k truck and the dealers would try and sell them for 30k minimum and even then not order alot of units of them', 'cheap 50k truck coming', 'i dont see a lower cost version of the 1500 being that successful not anymore than chevys work truck models\n\nif ram reentered the small truck market akin to the maverick at a low price point they could see success', 'what are they going to do bring the rampage to the us', 'i just want a truck that has a bed and can tow 5k pounds my trailer  boat is 4k']",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jef3y0/ram_owner_wants_to_bring_cheaper_pickup_back_to_us/,0.0,-0.8756,"[-0.5106, -0.7964, -0.5574, -0.1779, 0.765, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8068, 0.0, 0.0772]",-0.10574166666666666

nvidia announces blackwell ultra and vera rubin ai chips,"nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual gtc conference on tuesday 

ceo jensen huang revealed blackwell ultra a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year as well as vera rubin the companys nextgeneration graphics processing unit or gpu that is expected to ship in 2026

nvidias sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of openais chatgpt in late 2022 thats because its big gpus have most of the market for developing advanced ai a process called training

software developers and investors are closely watching the companys new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the companys biggest end customers  cloud companies including microsoft google and amazon  to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around nvidia chips

tuesdays announcements are also a test of nvidias new annual release cadence the company is striving to announce new chips on an everyyear basis before the ai boom nvidia released new chips every other year 

the gtc conference in san jose california is also a show of strength for nvidia 

the event nvidias second inperson conference since the pandemic is expected to have 25000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the companys hardware for ai that includes waymo microsoft and ford among others 

nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event 

for example nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips including two aifocused pcs that will be able to run large ai models such as llama or deepseek the company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of gpus together so they work as one

vera rubin

nvidia said on tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its nextgeneration gpu family in the second half of 2026 

the system has two main components a cpu called vera and a new gpu design called rubin its named after astronomer vera rubin

vera is nvidias first custom cpu design the company said and its based on a core design theyve named olympus 

previously when it needed cpus nvidia used an offtheshelf design from arm companies that have developed custom arm core designs such as qualcomm and apple say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance

the custom vera design will be twice as fast as the cpu used in last years grace blackwell chips the company said 

when paired with vera rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference more than double the 20 petaflops for the companys current blackwell chips rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory which is one of the core specs that ai developers watch

nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a gpu rubin is actually two gpus nvidia said 

the blackwell gpu which is currently on the market is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip

starting with rubin nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip it will refer to them as separate gpus in the second half of 2027 nvidia plans to release a rubin next chip that combines four dies to make a single chip doubling the speed of rubin and it will refer to that as four gpus

nvidia said that will come in a rack called vera rubin nvl144 previous versions of nvidias rack were called nvl72

blackwell ultra

nvidia also announced new versions of its blackwell family of chips that it calls blackwell ultra

that chip will be able to produce more tokens per second which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor nvidia said in a briefing

nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use blackwell ultra to offer a premium ai service for timesensitive applications allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the hopper generation which shipped in 2023

blackwell ultra will come in a version with two paired to an nvidia arm cpu called gb300 and a version with just the gpu called b300 it will also come in versions with eight gpus in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 blackwell chips

the top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of blackwell chips as hopper chips nvidia said

deepseek

chinas deepseek r1 model may have scared nvidia investors when it was released in january but nvidia has embraced the software the chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products

many ai observers said that deepseeks model which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the us threatened nvidias business

but huang said earlier this year that deepseek was actually a good sign for nvidia thats because deepseek uses a process called reasoning which requires more computing power to provide users better answers 

the new blackwell ultra and vera rubin chips are better for reasoning models nvidia said 

its developed its chips to more efficiently do inference so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment nvidias chips will be able to handle it

in the last 23 years a major breakthrough happened a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened we call it agentic ai huang said it can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem

tesla board members executive sell off over 100 million of stock in recent weeks,"as tesla stock has fallen in recent weeks members of the board and an executive at elon musks company have been selling off millions of dollars in stock according to filings with the us securities and exchange commission

together four top officers at the company have offloaded over 100 million in shares since early february

last week longtime musk ally james murdoch  the estranged son of fox boss rupert murdoch and a board member since 2017  became the latest to do so exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately 13 million according to an sec filing the sale took place on march 10 coinciding with the stocks largest singleday decline in five years

according to one filing the shares were sold to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531787 shares which are scheduled to expire in 2025

elon musks brother kimbal musk who also sits on the board unloaded 75000 shares worth approximately 27 million last month according to a filing

the chairman of the board robyn denholm has offloaded more than 75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks federal filings show the selloffs made by denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan

a number of board members and executives made similar moves in november and december but the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for tesla with the stock falling nearly 50 from a peak in middecember the companys shares have suffered most of those losses since president donald trump took office and musk began his controversial governmental costcutting efforts as the head of the newly created department of government efficiency

whenever insiders including directors are selling shares its not a positive signal jay ritter a professor of finance at the university of florida told abc news

however ritter added an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by denholm in july 2024 which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information

filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common ritter said

tesla did not immediately respond to abc news request for comment

seth goldstein an analyst at research firm morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers

while a sale doesnt necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a companys outlook it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued goldstein said

the share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about 118 million but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options the costs of which totaled about 16 million the officers ended up with a profit of just over 100 million

abc news previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds some of whom have called on musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company

tesla chief financial officer vaibhav taneja also sold off shares totaling more than 5 million over recent weeks some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale

germanys defense splurge set to favor european companies,"

 european weapons manufacturers from thyssenkrupp ag to bae systems plc and smaller drone makers stand to gain the most from germanys massive defensespending splurge according people familiar with the matter after comments by president donald trump raised doubts about the uss commitment to transatlantic cooperation
 
 at the top of berlins shopping list are six f127 battleships from germanys thyssenkrupp marine systems valued at more than 15 billion 164 billion and 20 added eurofighter jets from bae and its partners worth some 3 billion said the people who spoke on condition of anonymity as the procurement plans arent public
 
 the emphasis on europeanmade gear marks a departure from germanys previous 100 billion splurge in 2022 a strong buy american component in that debtfinanced deal orchestrated by outgoing chancellor olaf scholz led to orders for 35 f35 fighter jets 60 chinook transport helicopters made by boeing co and patriot airdefense systems
 
 german lawmakers this week are expected to pass sweeping changes to the constitution that will remove borrowing restriction for defense spending in excess of 1 of gross domestic product or roughly 45 billion 49 billion as most of the 100 billion from the special fund to modernize the bundeswehr armed forces is either spent or earmarked the new legislation will open the flood gates for additional defense procurement projects of unprecedented scale
 
 european defensefocused stocks have been among the biggest gainers this year as governments make a more concerted push to increase their military budgets and seek to procure more from their home region us arms shipments still make up the majority of exports to nato countries meaning europe has to catch up if it wants to gain a bigger share of the investments
 
 germanys latest spending plans have been influenced by signs that the us will be a lessreliable partner in europes defense after the returning us president briefly stopped arms shipments to ukraine and threatened
 not to help nato allies if they dont spend more on defense his close adviser elon musk has suggested exiting the postworld war security alliance
 
 germanys defense ministry is poised to start negotiations with thyssenkrupp marine to buy six more of the nextgeneration fregatte 127 to replace three antiaircraft frigates of the socalled saxony class from 2035 onwards according to the people
 the thyssenkrupp unit formed a joint venture last year with domestic shipbuilder naval vessels lrssen to pitch for the f127 order the deal which could even surpass the targeted price tag of 15 billion is likely to be passed by budget lawmakers in the second half of this year the people added
 
 a defense ministry spokesman declined to comment
 
 another big order will be the purchase of 20 added eurofighter jets in a contract worth up to 3 billion the people said the eurofighter is made by a partnership led by britains bae francogerman aircraft manufacturer airbus se and italys leonardo spa
 
 scholz announced the intention for the purchase in a speech at the berlin air show in june 2024 but the order so far was not executed due to disagreements over spending priorities in the outgoing coalition
 
 shifting priorities
 
 some lawmakers had argued that germany shouldnt invest too much in fighter jets after the 10 billion purchase of the 35 lockheed martin corp f35s in 2022 ate up roughly one 10th of the first special fund
 
 with budget constraints soon to be lifted berlin will now push ahead with the eurofighter order to balance out its military procurement and put a bigger emphasis on european manufacturers the people said in 2020 germany placed an order for 38 eurofighter jets worth 55 billion
 
 germany also plans to invest several billion euros into the modernization of its military satellite infrastructure the people said one beneficiary could be ohb se the bremenbased manufacturer that won a 21 billion german order last year
 
 other spending targets include hundred of millions of euros for artillery ammunition according to the people including by exercising options on existing contracts with germanys rheinmetall ag and others germany also plans more investments in air defense after large parts of the first fund were spent to buy irist systems from bavariabased diehl patriot systems from the us and arrow 3 from israel and the us the people added
 
 further billions of euros will be spend on more submarines and a yet to be developed drone strategy which will lead to various orders from german manufacturers like helsing or quantum systems the people said",384,2025-03-18T21:25:36,32,"['it would be idiotic to buy us made in the current geopolitical climate\n\ni vote for cutting the cheeto king completely off from our defence spending', 'no point in buying us weapons and risked getting support for them cancelled when you really need it', 'while they do that also ban x from eu as its just a propaganda tool to spread misinformation and lies while glorifying nazi and hitler  \n\neu should totally ban x and nurolink while tariffing tesla', 'americans should realize f35 supply chain is global\n\nand europeans should understand they can stop producing the important parts they make for the f35 and fuck over the usa\n\nso lets not pretend the usas kill switch in this specific context is that much different that what european countries can do to f35 production if they ever wanted to', 'party like its 1939', 'rolls royce loves that', 'this will benefit all kinds of companies in the value chain see for example steyr motors annual report published today', 'and to google', 'rhm  prime for shorting if its not at the top already its very near', 'at this point its more reliable to buy chinese arms than american \n\nbut honestly this should never be the case european nations should have kept more autonomy and the french were right for years about this']",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je89t6/germanys_defense_splurge_set_to_favor_european/,0.4939,0.9758,"[-0.5719, -0.6486, -0.872, -0.8418, 0.6369, 0.5719, 0.6597, 0.0, -0.1511, 0.6124]",0.07210000000000001
germany votes for historic boost to defence spending,"rollsroyce will benefit from eu defense spending



german lawmakers have voted to allow a huge increase in defence and infrastructure spending  a seismic shift for the country that could reshape european defence

a twothirds majority of bundestag parliamentarians required for the change approved the vote on tuesday

the law will exempt spending on defence and security from germanys strict debt rules and create a 500bn 547bn 420bn infrastructure fund

this vote is a historic move for traditionally debtshy germany and could be hugely significant for europe as russias fullscale invasion of ukraine grinds on and after us president donald trump signalled an uncertain commitment to nato and europes defence

google to acquire cloud security startup wiz for 32 billion,"google on tuesday signed a definitive agreement to acquire wiz the new yorkbased cloud security startup for 32 billion in an allcash deal according to releases

the deal which will be googles largestever acquisition will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats wiz will become a part of the companys cloud business google said it expects to close the deal in 2026

google cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure with deep ai expertise and a track record of industryleading security innovation google said in a release bringing all this to wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds

the acquisition comes after cnbc reported in july that wiz had walked away from a potential 23 billion acquisition by google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead

saying no to such humbling offers is tough wiz cofounder assaf rappaport wrote to employees in a july memo obtained by cnbc at the time a source familiar with the matter told cnbc that wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns

before talks with google were reported wiz had set its sights on two goals an ipo and 1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the memo at the time rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones

wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under rappaport with the company hitting 100 million in annual recurring revenue after just 18 months the companys cloud security products include prevention active detection and response a portfolio thats appealed to large firms and would have helped google compete with microsoft which also sells security software

becoming part of google cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company rappaport said in a blog post tuesday

google has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers its largest deal before wiz was the 125 billion acquisition of hardware marker motorola in 2012 two years later the company sold some assets to lenovo for 29 billion google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past paying 54 billion for mandiant in 2022

wizs products will still work on competitor platforms including amazon web services microsoft azure and oracle cloud the companies said the wall street journal first reported monday that the companies were in advanced discussions

while the agreement may still draw government scrutiny many on wall street have been hopeful that president donald trumps new white house administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance

games workshop stock is warhammer worth more than star wars when acquired by disney,"this post is in relation to games workshop lon gaw the 466 billion 593b usd tabletop gaming titan behind warhammer

my thesis warhammers universe intellectual property ip and ecosystem are worth more than gaws current market cap and what disney paid for star wars in 2012 405b or 554b in 2025 dollars

i know this might sound bold one can say that warhammers a niche  not a mainstream beast like star wars was however as someone thats been closely monitoring latest developments of warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore a rabid fanbase and catalysts like henry cavills amazon series this could be a sleeper hit the markets undervaluing

lets break it down

gaw is the king of tabletop wargaming crafting warhammer universes40k grimdark scifi age of sigmar fantasy and the old world retro fantasy founded in 1975 by steve jackson and ian livingstone with owl and weasela newsletter that became white dwarf in 1977its been building lore for 50 years today its a 145share stock with

 market cap 466b 593b
 revenue 2024 5775m 735m up 156 cagr over 5 years
 margins 71 gross 41 operating 30 netinsanely efficient
 cash 1258m net debt negative 794m
 pe 271pricey but growth justifies it

warhammers niche 12m players dropping 200500year on minis paints and books its not disneys scale but its a moathighmargin loyal and sticky

 the thesis warhammers ip is worth more than 59b and star wars 2012 price gaws 59b cap reflects a tabletop business but warhammers ip its lore brand and potential could fetch 910b if sold to a disneyamazonnetflix 

edit i am just trying to value whs ip and gaw not saying i want it to be sold or anything

why

its a 50year universe with untapped multimedia juice and its firing on all cylinders in 2025 lets compare

 disneys star wars deal 405b in 2012 554b today got lucasfilmsix films 44b box office 20b in merchandise 35 years of lore disney turned it into 12b by 2024
 warhammer today no films yet but 735m revenue 50 years of history and a lore deeper than star wars10000 years of 40k chaos gods space marines plus old world nostalgia licensings just 38m5 of revenuebut its a powder keg

valuation math

 core revenue 735m x 8 media ip multiple  588b
 licensing upside 500myear from filmstv star warsscale x 5  25b
 50year brand premium  12b
 total 910babove gaws cap and star wars 2012 price

crazy maybe but warhammers fans are deep into it warhammers got potential

 why now 2025 is lighting up

1 warhammer 40k 10th edition
    launched june 2023 drove 108 core revenue growth in 2024 490m halfyear to dec 2024 164 up 3075m

 warhammer vs star wars

warhammers no star wars yet star wars had mass appeal warhammers a cult with 12m players but

 lore 50 years denser than star wars 35 in 2012 black library churns 20 novelsyearhorus heresy alone is 60 books
 fanbase smaller but fanaticplayers cocreate painting campaigns star wars sold toys warhammer sells a lifestyle
 upside star wars had films in the can warhammers a blank slate cavills series could be its force awakens

some say warhammers too niche i say it has a potential future mass craze

910b is what a buyer pays for potential not just todays market cap

 now 145 pe 27 42 dividend yield fair value 150160 eps 535 to 6
 bull case revenue hits 850m by 2027 cavill old world eps 9 pe 25  22550 upside
 buyout a 9b bid spins the ip to amazon triples licensing in 5 years

risks cavill flops old world fadesgrowth slows to 5 stock stalls at 150 but gaws 67 roic and monopoly scream resilience imo

 thank you in advance for your feedback on my comparison of warhammer to star wars

uneducated on economic theoryhistory and will say its just political emotion guiding the fervor and for many that may be true \n\nhowever the 5 causes of the great depression were\n\n\n1 death of world trade due to smoothawkey tariffs \n\n2 government policies destroying what was built under trs progressive era\n\n3 collapse of money supply\n\n4 bank failures as public panicked\n\n5 1929 stock market crash\n\n\nyou can see the recipe is there for trump to repeat hoovers missteps whether he will or not is the uncertainty we are seeing play out in the market uncertainty isnt good but its not a depression causing event and corrections happen every few years\n\nbut what do i know im on here spouting opinions with no degree in economics too', 'the us empire is happening because of the market going down\n\ntheres no one saying that the us is falling because the market went down\n\nthere are reasonable arguments that the us is falling because of real macroeconomic and political blunders by the trump admin and thats being reflected in the market\n\nis there any reason to think it wont go back up after a year or 2\n\nus is a 70 consumer based economy with 70 of our gdp being consumer spending trump seemingly wants to flip that making us a producer economy rather than a consumer economy so theres naturally going to be a capital shift if that happens and theres really no other large consumption economies out there so goods in the short term will get much more expensive and thats going to lead to lower consumption and a recession\n\nalso why do business with the us if its going to just change every 4 years and swing between being an adult and a petulant child would you invest in the american economy i wouldnt so if the us becomes less safe of an investment then people are going to take their money out of the us market and invest elsewhere', 'youre confusing causation\n\npeople arent saying a depression and imperial collapse is happening because the market is going down theyre saying the market is going down because of the imperial collapse the evidence for that rapid decline is everywhere the only real question is how fast', 'well see what happens after tariffs are implemented reciprocal tariffs and then trump increases tariffs on countries that implement said reciprocal tariffs', 'you have everything backwards the fall of the stock market is not the reason people are worried about the fall of the us empire and the end of democracy and the american experience the stock market is reflecting those fears not informing them what happened in 2002 when we did not have a tyrant with no checks and balances no congress courts being ignored with no enforcement mechanism is completely irrelevant', 'it feels different this time because it seems the entire government structure in the us is changing its ending government funded stem projects which had always been the reason why the us is the leader of the world tariffs are not viewed favorably and the possibility of world war 3 seems to be on the horizon', 'the obvious difference is that in 2022 the global economy faced a very real supply shock due to the impact covid had on labor markets the federal reserve and biden administration managed to do something that had never previously been done in american history by taming inflation while also growing gdp\n\nthe market shocks happening today are completely selfinduced by an insane overreaching government which increases the risk that this time things will not be fixed in an orderly fashion\n\npersonally i believe that markets are overestimating the tolerance america will have for a president that insists on being this destructive and events will force him to moderate but i cant see the future', 'back in the 1970s we had stagflation that hounded us for years the market went sideways not crashing nor going up just bouncing along not doing much its possible were in that pattern right now \n\nbut its also possible were in a bull trap and were about to take a dive we can get a crash and a prolonged recession \n\nadd high unemployment to either of those situations then add bird flu then add inflation then add global conflicts then add civil unrest and its going to be a perfect shitstorm \n\nit will be unlike 2022 which was mostly covid and lockdown related 2025 hits different', 'theres hyperbole on here because

alphabet in talks to buy cloud security firm wiz for 33 billion,"


 alphabet inc is in talks to purchase the cloud security company wiz for 33 billion restarting deal discussions that were called off last summer after extended negotiations according to people familiar with the matter 

 the deal which could be announced as soon as tuesday would bolster the cybersecurity offerings for alphabets google cloud and provide it with a crucial marketing boost to compete against its larger cloud competitors amazoncom incs amazon web services and microsoft corps azure

 for wiz the deal represents a reversal after the company turned down alphabets 23 billion offer last july sticking instead with a plan to remain independent and eventually pursue an initial public offering wiz and its investors balked at the deal in part because of worries of a protracted regulatory approval process with competition authorities in the us and europe focusing on the tech sector for its economic sway and market power

if the fed decides to keep rates steady tomorrow without dropping then i expect a 3 drop,"edit i cant change the title  the fed meeting is on wednesday not tomorrow 

if there is an interest rate drop then we have bottomed and in for another bull run

there is a prevailing theory especially among the maga crowd that trump was playing 4d chess and tanking the market on purpose to get the fed to drop rates fulfilling a campaign promise and allowing trump to refinance a large portion of the government debt at lower rates i think most levelheaded investors dont thing this is true while i dont agree with the hypothesis we know that shortterm moves in the market are generally not based on fundamentals 

i also think that if powell edited doesnt drop rates which is the expectation then the next social media post that trump makes will be something along the lines of powell needs to be fired and that will add more uncertainty to the market if anything we mostly like powell because hes been so transparent do we know what a trump appointed fed chair would do

retail investors ditch buythedip mentality during the market correction,"


individual investors whose assets are more tied to the stock market than ever have abandoned their triedandtrue dipbuying mentality as the sp 500

recently fell into a painful 10 correction

retail outflows from us equities rose to about 4 billion over the past two weeks as tariff chaos and mounting economic concerns caused a threeweek pullback in the sp 500 according to data from barclays during marchs selloff 401k holders have been aggressively trading their investments to the tune of four times the average level according to alight solutions data going back to the late 1990s

if people were trying to buy the dip and get their stocks on sale maybe you would see people actually buying largecap equities but instead we see people selling from large capequities said rob austin director of research at alight solutions so this does appear to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity

the increased selling came as american households are more sensitive than ever to the turbulence in the stock market us household ownership of equities has reached a record level amounting to nearly half their financial assets according to federal reserve data

dipbuying had served investors well over the past two years as main street rode the artificial intelligenceinspired bull market to record highs at one point the sp 500 went more than 370 days without even a 21 selloff the longest such stretch since the global financial crisis of 200809

but lately markets began to sour as president donald trumps aggressive tariffs and sudden changes in policy stirred up volatility stoking fears of dampened consumer spending slower economic growth weaker profits and maybe even a recession the sp 500 officially entered a correction late last week and is now sitting some 87 below its february alltime high

still retail traders are far from throwing in the towel for example the net debit of margin accounts a popular proxy for retail investors sentiment continues to stay elevated according to barclays data

there is plenty of room for retail investors to further disengage from the equity market analysts led by venu krishna barclays head of us equity strategy said in a note tuesday to clients we are of the view that retail investors have in no way capitulated

barclays proprietary euphoria indicator shows sentiment has been brought down to levels similar to where it was around the time of the us presidential election in november but is still high by historic standards

its not like everybody is going out there saying the sky is falling most people it looks like are not making any sort of reactions austin said

2035 which would be closer to a 6040 composition \n\n do you have any bond funds a high yield bond etf like ibhe yields 675 and provides diversification absent of force majeure the majority of these bonds are bb or higher and likely wont default \n\n what are the dividend yields of the current funds the majority of recessions arent as catastrophic as the great recession or great depression in these times solid bluechips usually maintain their dividend you can diversify into jepi or schd which pays around 3 dividend and will yield income despite the capital loss during a downturn \n\ngood

market downturn are smallcap stocks more promising is this stocks heavy volume decline signaling something,"over the past month the us stock market has shown a trend of volatility and decline with both the sp 500 and nasdaq indices experiencing pullbacks market sentiment has noticeably cooled and an increasing number of institutions are turning bearish on the broader market citing concerns over federal reserve policies weak macroeconomic data and disappointing corporate earnings as factors that will continue to weigh on us stocks in such a market environment risk aversion is high and largecap tech stocks and other heavyweight equities are under pressure however on the flip side smallcap stocks may present a wave of structural opportunities



why might smallcap stocks be more attractive

1 low valuation and capital speculation

many smallcap stocks are currently trading at extremely low valuations in a liquiditytight market some capital may seek shortterm opportunities for oversold rebounds due to their small market capitalization and high concentration of shares smallcap stocks are often more susceptible to being pushed by capital during periods of amplified market volatility

2 shift in market attention

as largecap growth stocks face significant valuation repair pressures some capital may shift towards shortterm highervolatility targets for speculation smallcap stocks offer more pronounced shortterm trading opportunities in this context aifu as an ultralow marketcap stock could be influenced by speculative capital institutions or market sentiment creating volatile trading opportunities



recent technicals and capital movements in aifu

1 heavy volume decline is institutional participation possible

recently aifu has experienced a noticeable heavy volume decline with trading volume significantly higher compared to previous months typically heavy volume declines can be interpreted in two ways

 panic selling retail investors and some traders may be selling off due to the unfavorable market environment leading to a sharp drop in the stock price

 institutional capital adjusting positions if institutions are positioning themselves they may be accumulating shares at lower prices while creating some market panic to secure better entry points

2 longterm sub1 price and delisting pressuredriven speculation

 aifu has been trading below 1 for an extended period placing it under the nasdaq delisting rule observation period if the stock remains below 1 for 30 consecutive trading days the company will receive a delisting warning and must regain compliance within 180 days

 this may spark market speculation about potential selfrescue measures such as capital operations announcements reverse stock splits or priceboosting actions such uncertainty could act as a catalyst for shortterm trading opportunities



what key points should investors focus on

1 market sentiment shifts if the broader market continues to decline smallcap stocks may still be dragged down however during such phases capital is often more willing to speculate on smallcap stocks and lowpriced stocks like aifu may experience more pronounced volatility

2 capital movements closely monitor trading volume and position changes to identify abnormal capital inflows or outflows as well as any public shifts in institutional holdings

3 company announcements and compliance measures will aifu take actions such as reverse stock splits share buybacks or other capital operations to maintain compliance these factors could influence the stocks shortterm trajectory



risks and opportunities coexist

aifu is currently in a highrisk but potentially shortterm speculative opportunity phase in the current environment of subdued market sentiment the volatility of smallcap stocks has intensified and some capital may exploit lower prices for shortterm trading however investors need to focus on risk management monitoring changes in trading volume market sentiment and potential company announcements to assess whether institutional involvement or capital operations are at play for shortterm traders aifu could be a stock worth watching",0,2025-03-19T07:48:25,8,"['micro cap with nothing positive happening with earnings \n\nim not saying youre a scammer but if you were youd be pitching a stock like aifu', 'portillos is a much better small cap gem \n\ndont listen to op if youre going to buy a stock based off the words of an internet stranger buy portillos', 'please stop posting low effort stuff written with ai', 'this post was written by ai lmao low effort probably a scam', 'op is too close to the trees to see the forest\xa0', 'deleted', 'the stock or a sandwich and the chopp salad', 'dude youre about to take a big fat loss whatever subreddit youtube scammers or discord guru you saw talk about this is something you need to avoid\n\n\n\n\nthis is a penny stock its litterary on the brink of delisting and after thag bankruptcy due to low volume its somewhat easy to manipulate thus itll be pumped online by some people those you listen to and as you and other so called pigs buy theyll sell this means your money goes into their pockets and youre left with a worthless stock that gets delisted and you cant trad eit anymore youll lose every cent\n\n\n\nand that kids is why pennystocks are infamous amongst investors high volume makes people think theyll get rich but justabout everyone whos not a big influencer gets scammed', 'both']",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jemp53/market_downturn_are_smallcap_stocks_more/,0.4576,0.7826,"[0.3156, 0.4404, -0.25, -0.2263, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.5182, 0.0]",0.09106363636363636

advice for how to relay the economy to my parents,hi guys 26m here since 2021 i have introduced my mum and dad into the world of investing they have around 40k invested into ftse global all caps index

fear mongering news about tesla and vanguard owning 7 my mum seems to panic everytime i have told them time and time again what investing involves and that years like this will happen but overall theyre still up how can i reassure them or adjust my approach to telling them that things like this are normal in the markets and basically that having their money in a standard savings account is

should i invest my down payment,"hi all 

as the title suggests i am considering various tools to store and grow my savings in order to purchase my first home right now i can set aside 2500 a month and potentially increasing monthly contribution over time and am hoping to get to 300k in about 5 years i have read that some people think its best to put the money in a hysa or money market fund that is more riskaverse and liquid while some suggested a more aggressive and longterm approach such as investing in an index fund like sp500 and others think it should be a split between the two 

  
i want to hear what you all think especially from people who successfully planned and saved for their down payment in the recent past what was your approach and how did it work out in the end if you were splitting between a savings account and a brokerage account what do you recommend the ratio to be what are some other tools that you think are helpful for this purpose

also would love to hear from financial advisors or real estate professionals im here to learn and any tips are welcome

pepsi pep buys probiotic soda poppi for 195 billion to expand their presence in the functional soda market paying 13x topline revenue,"shares of pepsi closed 185 up today some information about poppi the acquisition target

 founded in 2018 by a couple they reported upwards of 100 million in sales in 2024 even if we round up to 150 million in sales pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit realistically 195x top line revenue on the 100 million reported if we dont use the rounded up 150 million figure

 the company previously appeared on shark tank and sold 25 of the business to rohan oza for a 400000 investment rohan oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as vita coco and vitaminwater to market

 the company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including post malone hailey bieber kylie jenner billie eilish russell westbrook jennifer lopez and olivia munn

 poppi was previously sued in california class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks with only 2g of fiber a consumer would have to drink 4 cans to realize any potential health benefits

interested to hear what people think about this acquisition

 is poppi overvalued and did pepsi overpay

 should pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management its hard to imagine that with pepsis scale in manufacturing marketing retail partnerships etc it have cost more than 195 billion to make a competing offering that could reach 100 million in sales within 6 years

 naturally my next thought was given the above on valuation is the poppi brand worth almost 2 billion maybe its not the sales they are after but the formulation the brand or the marketing partnerships

 will pepsi change the formula leading to turning off long time customers

thinking', 'theres a mathematical reason why leveraged etfs are not recommended to be held for long periods of time\n\nin your case as long as you understand letf volatility drag the underlying index of the letf you buy is not extremely volatile and you understand that purchasing an letf is one of the most aggressive and risky moves one could make but its still within your risk tolerance then go for it i guess\n\nthat being said you will probably want to rebalance letf positions much much more often than annually and not at arbitrarily regular intervals\n\nif the reasoning behind any of this didnt make sense to you dont do it you are not prepared', 'have you modeled these funds out yet\n\nif you are bullish then look at soxl tqqq ladu tna fas or gush they collapse when there is any weakness in the market', 'i think you need to spend some more time with the math on the decay these levered etfs are really only meant to be held daily  \n\nlong term holds will crush you if its a small portion of your portfolio only that portion will get crushed but why would you want that', 'a common sensible approach is to just use upro or sso to juice your us exposure and then diversify with alts\n\nlike rsst gives you 2x by giving you 11 spymanaged futures or rssb which is 11 vtief essentially or ntsx gives you 9060 spyief\n\ninstead you can get a way higher volatility contribution from longer duration bonds which is similar to buying that bond leverage but without the leverage costs for example long duration behaves like tyd but without embedded leverage costs\n\nthis is by far in my opinion the way to go especially for younger investors youth can handle vol and buying even as much as 2x leverage on raw equities has been shown to be more optimal than unlevered equities in papers like ayers and nalebuffs research on leverage even in the circumstance that you wipe out in an event like the gfc and start again from zero \n\ni prefer a less crazy approach and take traditional portfolio construction wisdom and simply add modest leverage to it slide out on bond duration to the long end and diversify with managed futures i get global equity exposure trend following funds long bonds and its all great the three asset classes are uncorrelated to each other they all have positive real expected returns and they should help crutch each other when tail events

tlt dd,"in short buy tlt calls in long

 introduction

fellow regards im sure we are all aware that the all powellful jerome will be determining at the fed meeting today how hard a fucking our significant others boyfriend will be pumping out yet fewer have discussed what move they will be making based on this situation my thesis is simple  the market has mispriced the chance of a rate cut underestimating it and so to take advantage of that i have am in a long tlt position  a highlyleveragable longterm government bond etf ill first explain why i think theres a higher chance of a rate slash than the market is telling us specifically diving into why the market has been mispriced ill then move onto why this will cause tlt to rise and also why ive chosen tlt over other related assets

 why an interest rate cut seems likely to me

lets start with some basic economics modern monetary theory suggests that the fed uses interest rate hikes to lower inflation at the cost of weakening the economy raising unemployment while cuts strengthen the economy while causing inflation heres how our situation looks to me

first consider inflation to be completely honest i have been working on this thesis since before the release of cpi data for february  personally i expected annual inflation from january to february to fall from 3 to 29 so i waited until march 10th for a bit of confirmation bias i was greeted by

fig 11 cpi for february 2025 all goods

fig 12 12month inflation of february 2025 all goods

inflation has retreated more than expected falling to 28 one of the many reasons why an interest rate cut initially seemed unlikely was  due to concerns of sticky inflation  this has provided evidence that inflation is falling granted fed changes are not instant and ill address fears regarding inflation later on in more detail however this data has shown us that inflation isnt as bad as we thought itd be and seems to be falling  evidence in favour of a rate cut happening 

on the other hand the economy

fig 21 consumer sentiment data

consumer sentiment has completely crashed falling 10 from febuary to march with expectations showing an even bleaker result

fig 22 consumer spending falls in january 2025

actual spending has also fallen  for the first time in a long time people are spending less despite easing inflation and while preliminary data has appeared for february showing consumer spending has gone back up by 02 this is still underperforming expectations a weak consumer base unwilling to spend is never a good sign

fig 23 ism manufacturing  pmi index

fig 24 a more detailed look at the index

the manufacturing index has also seen better days the manufacturing pmi has fallen from 509 to 503 in february now in all fairness this still means there is growth  any score above 50 indicates expansion  however it means that growth is slowing down and seems to be at an inflection point where itll start contracting again looking at the specifics we also see details that show new orders and employment numbers are contracting production and exports are seeing reduced growth all while imports are growing at an accelerated pace none of these show the signs of a confident economy but perhaps most important to us degenerates the stock market worries

fig 25 trillions wiped off the stock market in the last 2 weeks

im sure all of us remember last week when our portfolios got bent over by trump refusing to rule out a recession a recession i dont think it can be spelled out any clearer to even the passengers of the shortest of buses  trump does not seem to mind and in fact is open accepting of recession

fig 26 google searches for recession surging

another decent indicator of recession is also the number of google searches you see for it  clearly were amidst another breakout

fig 27 holy fucking shit

the long and short of it is that its not looking good crashing consumer expectations cratering stock prices manufacturing slowdowns  they all paint the picture of a recession coming up thus with inflation not too bad i believe that the fed should prioritise bringing back economic growth over keeping inflation down

 a mispricing in the market

so given the sorry state of our economy and comparatively better inflation control youd expect the market to price the chance of an interest rate cut at 40 maybe 20 maybe very low end 5 in reality

1 per cent

according to a popular betting market there is just a 1 chance powell will change the interest rate today now of course the betting market does not automatically correspond to what the stock market is thinking  however any investor that sees an obvious arbitrage opportunity like this would be able to make a 100fold return against tens of millions of dollars of liquidity if the stock market disagreed so it seems to me that this accurately reflects the general sentiment

heres the most important part of my dd that i want to emphasise in fact if theres any takeaway from my dd let it be this

i am not telling you jerome will definitely cut rates tomorrow in fact anyone claiming to know for sure what jerome will do tomorrow either has inside information is lying or is grossly misinformed the first group will never talk to the likes of us the second group is taking advantage of the likes of us and the third group belongs among the likes of us 

no all my dd hinges upon is the idea that the chance of an interest rate cut is higher than 1 thats all you need  the thought that interest rate cuts arent being priced in correctly and thats where any real money is made  mispricings in the market i personally dont see how the chance of an interest rate cut is not higher than 5  if your takeaway from my analysis is that it will be anything above 1 you too believe there is a mispricing in the market and can profit from purchasing tlt 

so this begs the question of why theres a market mispricing

 why is there a mispricing  but youre forgetting about

there are a couple ideas that people can bring up to suggest why interest rate cuts are unlikely  ill try and cover the main ones and deliver a rebuttal on all of them

firstly theres concern of inflation from trumps tariffs this is not unfounded  tariffs are inflationary and perhaps the worry of inflation is too great to cut rates firstly id like to point out that many of trumps other policies are deflationary deregulation and government spending cuts are both deflationary and i dont think we truly realise how likely tailend events like cutting half of military spending is with an unpredictable guy like trump  hes discussed it before secondly jerome powell himself has stated at the university of chicago booth school of business on march 7th that tariffs may cause a one off price hike but that longerterm expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2 inflation goal a oneoff rise in inflation will not need to be adjusted for  as powell correctly ascertains policies should only deal with persistent inflation

secondly some will mention that powell himself has said before that it is not in a hurry to cut interest rates i will point out that these quotes are all from before march 10th before trump refused to rule out the chance of a recession before the stock market plummeted and lost trillions of dollars and before we saw consumer confidence sour so drastically the situation has changed and powell is now much more likely to slash rates

finally the previous point already alludes to this but one idea is that theres a conflict between trump and powell in the way that trump is almost trying to cause economic panic to force powell into lowering interest rates people will have you believe that big j in an attempt to win this dickswinging contest will refuse to back down and keep interest rates constant maybe maybe but whats more important than winning the measuring contest is preventing the ruin that will come to millions if we fail to cushion economic downturn jerome does not want to be the guy who failed to do enough and saw america go through a recession or worse in fact ill go so far as to say the opposite  i think powell is likely to fold now due to his past expereince many criticisms have been levelled against the man on account of the fact that he didnt hike rates early enough in 2021 which led to outofcontrol inflation i think that its likely that he has learned from this mistake and id err on him acting sooner rather than later on cutting rates

most important to keep in mind however is that maybe you still have doubts about if jerome is likely to cut interest rates keep in mind  were not asking if its more likely hell cut rates or keep them the same were asking if the market is mispriced  if the chance hell cut rates is higher than 1 any bit of edge is a bullish indication for tlt

 ok i think the chance of a cut is higher than 1 how do i make money off that

minimising risk its arguably the one of the core tenets of the stock market  the idea of a net worth rising in a safe and predictable straight line is tantalising to all but the most degenerate regard its why so many rich people are willing to take a belowmarket return from a hedge fund  theres a team of brilliant asian quants out there who instead of curing cancer or perfecting interplanetary travel are creating the most ridiculous and incomprehensible financial products to tame risky and volatile assets into neat little beta neutral uncorrelated returns that beat the risk free rate by half a percent all for the price of a 220 fee structure theres money to be made in lowering risk

however youre in the wrong subreddit if youre that brilliant asian quant as such well be doing the opposite  taking the safest investment in the world  us treasury bonds and jacking it up to the tits in leverage to increase risk in return for enlarged profits

firstly treasury bonds are the asset of choice because i think that they will have the largest quick movement due to this mispricing in the market stock markets react unpredictably to interest rate movements  bonds do not for those who dont know when interest rates fall all new government bonds issued have lower coupon rates as such the old government bonds with comparatively higher coupon rates rise in value this is why government bonds rise in value when rates are cut and vice versa this is even more so for longterm treasury bonds compared to shortterm bills  since the coupon is paid out many more times the rise in value is exaggerated too

the liquid variety for longterm treasury bonds is the tlt an etf that tracks the bond price not only is the liquidity a plus but the asset being an etf allows you to buy options on it letting you purchase different calls until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance

unfortunately im a broke ass college student who has an evil satanic institutional broker that doesnt allow me to buy options so ive spent about half my money on tlt shares 

my 50 shares of tlt

 what next

now of course i dont know for sure if jerome will cut rates here are my rough plans based on what happens next

1 rates get cut

id expect tlt to rise sharply due to the market not expecting this cut happy days probably sell and throw the money into a global fund or maybe hold onto the position anticipating more cuts throughout the year

2 rates dont move

then in this case tlt probably wont move significantly since the market is pretty much expecting this outcome id probably hold onto my position a bit longer since if hes not cutting now he needs to cut by may this would also probably give me a generally bearish attitude on the us economy and stocks  i think this would be cutting rates a little too late probably start throwing more of my money into bonds and international markets

either way i think that this mispricing in the market can be capitalised on good luck regards

tariffs took effect at the beginning of the month and were subsequently ratcheted up businesses are already paying large sums extra for the same shipments they were getting last quarter profits are going to take a huge shot heres a good piece in wsj with a few case studies so far they rushed to beat some tariffs but time is up and theyve been paying big time

crispr tx dd,"crsp investment thesis

tldr innovative biotech company that is currently ramping up sales of its new innovative medicine which is the new standard of care in sickle cell disease large pipeline may lead to 50x growth from here according to ceos lofty goals several catalysts are expected in aprilmay and junejuly timeframe including updates q1 earnings updates on casgevy sales and data readouts on clinical programs outstanding question is the healthcare system ready for curative onetime therapies as compared to daily or weekly treatments

my credentials i have a ms in biotech and wrapping up my mba in healthcare i have worked in pharma business development for a few years now i have been following crsp since its ipo in 2018

my position

adding more on dips

background

crsp is a company developing medicine for genetic diseases using crispr gene editing technology the scientists who discovered this technology won the nobel prize in 2020 crsp has one marketed product casgvey that was developed via a collaboration with vertex pharmaceuticals to treat sickle cell disease they have a profit sharing arrangement which entitles them to 40 of all profits from casgevy while vertex manages the commercialization this is great because they have a builtup commercial team which has shown success at getting reimbursement from insurance and getting doctors to prescribe expensive treatments

the ceo says that they hope to be 100b biotech one day

financials as of 3182025

market cap  367b enterprise value  18b

net cash  19b

short interest  247 of the float significant short squeeze potential

70 institutional investors smart money

they have an average operating expenses of 130mquarter so absent any revenue from casgevy we can expect them to have funding to last at least the next three years and by then it is highly likely that there will be significant profits from casgevy this means that at the very least the dilution risk very low which is common among prerevenue biotech companies and is the main reason why they are often heavily shorted

macro

rate cutgrowth scare means biotech boom

commercial success

the ceo has said that there is tremendous patient interest in the therapy and more will be convinced as additional longterm safety data is generated ceo also says that they are currently ramping up approved treatments center  both the number of centers and how many patients each can treat

several analysts have projected that casgevy could reach 1b in sales as of 2026 and reach peak sales of 35b in 2030 per typical drug sales ramps as eoy24 there are 50 patients undergoing the casgevy therapy process as more treatment centers continue to open this therapy costs 22m and these 50 patients equate to sales of 110 million but it is unknown when that will be collected and if that is enough for profit to begin flowing to crsp it only takes a few dozen patients to be treated for this therapy to yield serious revenue for example that 1b target equates to 450 patients being treated out of a us patient pool of around 30k who are healthy enough to receive the treatment and have access through insurance however this cant continue forever and once you treat all the available patients you are only able to treat this disease at the incidence rate  of babies born with sickle cell but remember that if casgevy treats only half of that 30k patient population it will have made over 33b

recently there has been significant process at negotiating access for this therapy on both medicaremedicaid and private insurance companies the consensus insurance approach is outcomesbased agreements oba which would tie a portion of the payments to how well the treatment provide clinical benefit to patients link this is critical in providing access to patients and increasing commercial uptake

now lets take a look at my npv projections based on the analyst estimates above

projected npv of 6b considering the enterprise value of 18b this implies upside of 233 or a share price of 132 for reference the average analyst price target is 77

assumptions

        assumes 50 fcf margin       discount rate of 12       perpetual growth of 3 very conservative given pipeline       40 profit sharing in casgevy       peak sales for casgevy in 2030 estimated to be 35b       only values company on casgevy  

competitors

there is one other gene edit therapy in sickle cell develop by bluebird but they essentially just went bankrupt and sold to a private equity for pennies press release link not to mention their therapy also has a black box warning for hematological malignancies which is the kiss of death for therapies where there is a suitable alternative who would want to risk getting cancer  their therapy also costs 1m more than casgevy

since traditional medicine aka the previous standard of care only addressed the symptoms of sickle cell we expect almost no competition from the current market landscape 

there are likely to be several similar therapies from other gene editing competitor coming to market in the next 35 years but the firsttomarket usually secures a solid market share

clinical pipeline

crsp also has a solid extensive pipeline of moderately derisked assets in development ceo says that commercial success in casgevy will fund them to make strategic bets to fill their pipeline with 12 new drugs per year

      ctx310 ctx320  two candidates in vivo liver editing programs targeting lpa and angptl3 which expects data to be release in 1h 2025 recent presentations suggest between early april and early may the ceo stated that they will benefit from economies of scale the first program in their liver editing platform will cost 100m and each subsequent one will only cost 15m to develop because its a modular platform

      ctx112 ctx131  two allogenic cart cell therapy candidates targeting cd19 and cd70 which expect data to be released in mid2025 and q4 2025 respectively low cogs on allogenic carts make them a very attractive business model even if clinical data is only ok astrazeneca reached paid 1b for esobiotec an allogenic cart platform that is in the clinic link

      vctx210 vctx211  two regenerative medicine cell therapy replacement candidates for type 1 diabetes which expects an update in 2h 2025 we should be cautious about expecting much from this because their partner vertex has opted out of ownership and we do not know if that is because they plan to focus on their own cell therapy replacement or if something went wrong in the trial  ceo seemed upbeat about it in a recent presentation

its also important to note that crsp wholly owns all the clinical programs above so contrary to casgevy they will receive 100 of the profits feel free to look at their pipeline for more in depth analysis but that is not the focus of this research  there are also several preclinical programs but those will materially affect the stock price in my view because they are about at least 6 years from revenue generation

risks

      patients may not want to go through the cell depletion conditioning process required for this treatment  it is like chemotherapy

      insurance companies may not want to pay for the high price tag of casgevy 22m despite the long term clinical and cost benefits developing gene editing medicines is not a validated and proven business model very different economics from small molecules and biologics

      safety risks unknown new clinical data could come out which suggests that there are risks associated with crispr based medicine compared to more novel and targeted gene editing approaches like base editing or prime editing not sure what these would be but its definitely possible

     efficacy risks any of the their clinical programs might not generate enough efficacy to beat standard of care however it is widely accepted that precision medicine companies have significantly higher success rates

      competitors still in the clinic could deliver better data that would be the new standard of care in sickle cell which limits long term growths for casgevy

will bitcoin burn everyone this time,"microstrategy has accumulated nearly 500000 btc but they are now slowing down their purchases if they start liquidating strategically they could crash bitcoin without anyone noticing until its too late

imagine the perfect play

they sell slowly otc to avoid scaring the market

meanwhile they short btc with leverage to maximize profits

once support breaks they dump everything triggering liquidations

bitcoin crashes below 30k etfs see massive outflows and they cash in billions


if btc no longer grows exponentially microstrategy is trapped they either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset and if they decide to sell we could witness the biggest big short in crypto history

what to look for in fed meeting tomorrow 319,"jerome powells speech dont be too concerned with jerome powells speech tomorrow because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference the market rallied over 1 on that speech as jerome powell tried to calm the markets mostly consisted of wait and see and the data is still fine the truth is we had a decent cpi and jobs read for feb and pmi and consumer sentiment were mediocre the fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data

dot plot the most important thing to look for in the fomc meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot every major investment bank along with cme fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 23 cuts leaning more towards 3 if we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025 we could see a sharp repricing down as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 35

dec 2024 dot plot

summary of economic projections lastly is if the fed will project a lower gdp then in there last prediction in december they currently have it at 21 for 2025 which was raised from sept 2024s prediction of 20 but also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in december



dec 2024 projections

the last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts but also that gdp and unemployment would improve slightly as a result with new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in gdp or unemployment it really puts the fed in a tough place where these new projections for march almost seem certain to be downgrades

gdp 2025 projections

the other thing to note is that the 2025 gdp projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 fed members all picked 43 for 2025 and are less likely to all be swayed or moved

can newly released nvidia dynamo open source reasoning software save nvidias stock,"first we need to know what the nvidia dynamo open source reasoning software is for



the above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of nvidia dynamo as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on ai inference and its longterm positive effect on the companys stock price specifically



software functions and application scenarios



intelligent scheduling and resource allocation dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the nvidia triton inference server but also goes further by dynamically allocating gpu resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes ensuring that each gpu operates at high efficiency even under heavy load

optimizing large language model inference it adopts a decomposed service strategy distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple gpus which significantly improves throughput in practical applications for example when running the deepseekr1 model on certain rack clusters the number of tokens generated per gpu can be increased by approximately 30 times

multiframework support and expanded use cases as an opensource software dynamo can support various frameworks including pytorch and nvidia tensorrtllm making it suitable for cloud service providers data centers and enterprise ai factories

revolutionary significance



innovation in resource utilization by leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods

building an opensource ecosystem its opensource nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire ai industry

enhancing cost efficiency and performance by reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing gpu computational density the software is expected to make ai services more efficient and costcompetitive

potential impact on nvidias stock price in the long term dynamo is expected to help consolidate nvidias leadership in ai infrastructure especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price



why do i think nvidia dynamo opensource inference software will have a positive impact on nvdas stock price

because this software will substantially boost nvidias revenue in data center and cloud services



from the public earnings data and market expectations nvidias data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations especially in quarters driven by ai demand eg in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 data center revenue once accounted for 905

cninvestingcom

 while the fullyear average is much smoother estimates based on current public information and analysis



fy2023 data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43 of total annual revenue

fy2024 the market expects this to rise to around 50 or so driven by continued strong ai demand

fy2025 while some quarters eg q4 are particularly strong on average for the year the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50 and 55

a guide to the biggest ipo in history trashy dd on fnma and fmcc,"the guide to the biggest ipo in history

hello my highly regarded denizens and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of fannie mae and freddie mac from the bowels of hell government bureaucracy and the otc im going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this what kind of red flags ill be looking for and some background and context in case youre not familiar with this highly unusual situation

first off there are two securities you can buy here the first are the common stock fnma and fmcc for each of the companies you need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1 im personally weighted heavily towards these since inauguration but ill get more into that momentarily then there are the junior preferred shares each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters fnmas fnmat fnmaj for fannie and fmcch fmckj and fmcco for freddie 

in case youve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of the motley fool fannie mae and freddie mac are the two most profitable companies by employee and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet thats seven and a half trillion dollars in assets they buy up mortgages from banks dump em together in a various pots called securitizations and basically print money from the payments back in 08 the government made a determination based on secret filings that fannie and freddie were super dangerous and would have to print their earnings directly into the treasury department instead at the head of this conservatorship and controlling fannie and freddie is the federal housing finance agency

currently the us treasury department owns a million shares of the senior preferred shares sps at a value of around 200 billion they also own warrants equal to diluting the common stock by 80 the treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing fannie and freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08 and theres only three men who can do anything about that thankfully they have a raging boner of hatred for the government

junior preferred shares jps and commons are both available to common investors but only through the otc so robinhooders are in shambles again jps are more protected but have capped upside they have a par value aka a cap in price of either 25 or 50 and if dividends get turned on again only after a release covered below they get up to 8 of par first and then commons get the rest theres also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex jps and freddie commons but not fnma will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off after waiting two years and yes you read that right fmckj will be getting something like 3 in damages and as of 317 was trading at 10 

then theres common shares high risk ultra high reward depending on what kind of scenario plays out we could see share price hitting anything from sub 2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers to 34 if you believe bill ackman to price targets that you wouldnt fucking believe until i lay it all

right now heres the main events

relist currently commons and jps languish in otc purgatory 20 pops and drops on zero news zero halts and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit shambles rather than an ipo the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the nyse this will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from otc trading as well as making positions marginable including options theoretically they can uplist at any moment
recap based on arbitrary regulations fannie and freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee how much you ask it entirely depends on whos in charge back when mark calabria was running things they needed like 45 of their book as a reserve good thing that those capital requirements didnt stop payments from running straight out of fannie and freddies wallet into untraceable treasury accounts the specific phrase you need to parsing twitter headlines is ecrf which stands for everybody chill release fannie letting you know that if the amount is 15 fannie will be released within a year its just under the capital threshold if its lower than 15 fannie can be released immediately freddie is a little slower but he works just as hard you guys and he wont be far too far behind 
release dividends get turned back on justice is restored and angelic choirs announce the golden age of america

so let me give a couple of the red flags for free if you see these flee commons 
warrant exercise we know youve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended but this is definitely one warrant you cant escape diluting the float by 80 would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve your only saving grace might be that otc tends to trade headlines a day or two slow 
sps conversion just like a regular conversion this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy basically another form of dilution
need for continued study you know how when you had that hot band chick over to study and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over ap calc homework but she got angry that you werent paying enough attention to what she thought was important this is like that without significant internal pressure government impetus will stop any relistrecaprelease movement simply out of being the fact that theyre collectively lazy and stupid given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now progress needs to be made and quickly before gop control of all three branches is threatened specifically while some of these comments were made by scott bessent now treasury secretary and bill pulte now fhfa director that was before they were confirmed and based on everything im seeing were statements to basically placate the committees to get released these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions

heres what im imagining for green flags seriously there hasnt been a lot of public statements made about these companies but i think for good reasons mainly political
sps cancelled theres several good reasons to believe the treasurys stock will just straight go to zero first the treasury has been more than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08 altogether they got paid 340 billion over a 200 billion loan this raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it conserves which was one reason why a jury voted 80 to give damages in the fairholme case the continued existence of sps brings into question the very notion of property rights in america
warrants to be sold theres a lot of speculation about what the treasury would do with the warrants after a recaprelist a popular theory is that the treasury could gradually sell these assets off and allocate the money to whatever pet project this seems pretty likely given talk about a sovereign wealth fund and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc theres some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a swf which funds real estate development which pumps fnf raising warrant values higher etc
warrants to be cancelled the ultimate bull case if this happens commons will launch to mars and legends will be made some say the government would never go for this i say the government is run by the same man who brought us trumpcoin on inauguration weekend and we cant even know if he has a position since filings on otc are voluntary sure would be quite an artful deal if the decision maker about fhfa actions just so happened to have a position

so where are we at with this
trump a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale
bessent confirmed treasury secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight
pulte confirmed fhfa director who on the first day declared himself chairman of the board for fnf and cleared house on the board 
at this point im basically just waiting for an announcement it will probably come from bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with pulte to wind down fhfa but i wouldnt put it past trump to announce an executive order just ending it a la usaid there hasnt been much specifically said but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing while there could be progress made on the legal front final motion in fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years and the case still isnt even certified this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned 

positions ive been selling jps to capture some more volatility out of commons i plan to rotate around a bit 

but youre already up a lot dipshit tell me if it makes any sense for a 3 dividend to trade at 6 

you just want exit liquidity you just want to be able to breathe through your nose but that doesnt stop you from buying baba with less volume on the nyse than either fannie or freddie on the otc
