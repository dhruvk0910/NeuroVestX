stock equity itself \\n\\nive read a few books on stock options trading when i considered doing it not considering anymore and it always surprised me why people would do it because it seems way more risky and more importantly much much more difficult in stock options you often have to deal with not just the risk of the stocks price move but also implied volatility time decay and delta and on top of that you risk losing the entire premium paid for the option if the stocks price doesnt go overunder your strike price and these premiums can get very expensive if you lose a couple of bets in a row\\n\\nobviously theres multiple different ways you could combine these options to lower or amplify your risk but to me that just gives more points of riskfailure of losing your investment if you dont consider and do the proper dd\\n\\nthis is not to say people shouldnt trade options im just not smart enough to trade them profitably but for those of you who do trade options how profitable has it been for you and how much more difficult is it than simply trading stock equity and is the increased difficulty worth it', 'upvotes': 0, 'created_utc': datetime.datetime(2025, 3, 19, 20, 15, 47),
